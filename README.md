### Introduction
The project's aim is to build a basic calculator including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial and exponent.
The language I use is Python
To run this project you need to open the Jupyter Notebook and the .ipynb file which I have already uploaded on Github and Elms.
### Explanation of My Code 
The user needs to choose among the following 6 operations ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial and exponent)
If the user chooses Addition, he can enter three values and add them together
If the user chooses Subtraction, he should enter a minuend and a subtractor
If the user chooses Multiplication, he can enter three values to multiply them together
If the user chooses Division, he can enter a dividend and a divisor to calculate the answer 
If the user chooses Factorial, he can enter a positive integer that he wants to take the factorial of
If the user enter operation except for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and factorial, which is Exponent in this case, he can enter a base and an exponent to get the answer
